# @Hanifalhafizh10 Checkout Form Inspired

Here is a delightful checkout form built using Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS. It was inspired by a Twitter post from [@JimDesignsCo](https://x.com/jimdesignsco). You can find the post [here](https://twitter.com/JimDesignsCo/status/1737474070801691136).

Feel free to customize all the colors in the `tailwind.config.ts` and `main.css` files.
